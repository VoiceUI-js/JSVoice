**JSVoice** is a lightweight, dependency-free JavaScript library that brings the power of voice commands and speech synthesis to your web applications. It harnesses the browser's built-in Web Speech API to provide a seamless voice-interactive experience for your users.

Ideal for:

*   **Accessibility:** Enabling hands-free navigation and control.
*   **Voice-driven UIs:** Creating modern, voice-first user interfaces.
*   **Demos and Prototypes:** Quickly adding voice interaction to your projects.

For a full, detailed breakdown of the API and all options, please see our [DETAILED_DOCUMENTATION.md](DETAILED_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Key Features

*   üé§ **Voice Commands:** Start and stop voice recognition with a single function call.
*   üó£Ô∏è **Speech Synthesis:** Give your application a voice with the `speak()` helper.
*   ü§ñ **Built-in Actions:** Common actions like scrolling, zooming, and form filling work out-of-the-box.
*   üîß **Custom Commands:** Easily define your own voice commands and corresponding actions.
*   üîÑ **Automatic Restart:** Optionally, the library can automatically restart the recognition service.
*   üåê **Browser Support:** Gracefully degrades on browsers that do not support the Web Speech API.
*   üëç **Lightweight:** No external dependencies, keeping your application fast and lean.
